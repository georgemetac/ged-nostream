# --- The prediction-market provider's two LLM stages ---
#
# Both are RAW DICTS rather than built GeneralLlm singletons, unlike PARSER_LLM and friends:
# the provider is gated OFF by default, so paying construction cost at import would be waste,
# and the tests patch `build_llm_with_openrouter_fallback` at the provider's one invocation
# helper. Both route `openrouter/openai/...` through that wrapper, which tries the donated
# Metaculus key first and falls back to the personal key on credential / credit / route errors
# — so prod spend lands on OAI_ANTH_OPENROUTER_KEY.
#
# `allowed_tries=1` is required, not decorative: the repo's elapsed-gated `llm_retry` wrapper
# (prediction_market._invoke_market_llm) is the SOLE retry layer, and leaving this unpinned
# inherits forecasting-tools' default of 2 with an UN-GATED `random.uniform(5, 10)` tenacity
# sleep — a large slice of PREDICTION_MARKET_TIMEOUT spent sleeping blind, which is exactly
# what llm_retry exists to eliminate. `temperature=None` defers reasoning models to provider
# defaults (redundant on ft 0.2.92, whose ctor default is already None); top_p left unset. Each
# litellm `timeout` sits ABOVE its elapsed-gated wall cap in constants.py, so the wall is the
# binding bound.
#
# Luna is the cheapest tier that saturates both tasks. The measured rate on this route was
# $0.20/M in and $1.20/M out — TWICE the $0.10/$0.60 the bake-off read off the models API on
# 2026-08-03, where a "50% off" badge was displayed that has since lapsed or never applied here. A
# live ranking call reconciled the true rates to 7 significant figures against OpenRouter's own
# `upstream_inference_cost` (26,250 in / 685 out / a 25% cache-WRITE surcharge on the input,
# `scratch/market_port_2026-08-04/QA_DRY_RUN.md`), so this is measured rather than quoted.
# 2026-09-22: gpt-5.6-luna -> gpt-6-luna (GPT-6 release), now $0.10/$0.50 per 1M; the cost figures
# below predate that swap and are receipts, not current pricing.
#
# MEASURED cost per question: ranker $0.0074 (26k in at the median post-enrichment,
# full-PredictIt shape + ~685 out, cache write included); author ~1.4k in + ~300 out ≈ $0.0005.
# The two keyword calls they replace measured ~170 tok in / ~50 out ≈ $0.0001, so net new is
# ≈ +$0.008 per question — under a cent per run at the prod shape of 1-2 questions, and ~$0.24
# of ranker spend across a 30-question tournament run. The earlier ~$0.003-0.004 arithmetic in
# the port plan understated by 2.4x purely because of the promo price; the token shapes were
# right. This traffic is ~97% input, so the input rate is the whole cost.
